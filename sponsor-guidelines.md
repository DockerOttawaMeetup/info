# sponsor guidelines

Here are the basics:
- Sponsors pay for pizza and drinks for the meetup ($200).
- They get introduced at the beginning of the meeting, they get a slide, and they can give a short (2-3 minute overview) of who they are and why they are here (we try to make it fairly brief so that it doesn’t take over the meeting).
- Recruiters typically come with some handouts or swag and setup a table.  They usually stick around until the break (15 min break is after the first talk 7:15 ish).
- Sponsors usually get good traffic during the break.
- Sponsors get a link/picture in the Docker meetup page (most recent sponsor at the top).
- Refer to [Docker Meetup Sponsorship Guidelines](https://github.com/docker/community/blob/master/Organizers/Resources/sponsorship%20guidelines.md) for additional details.
