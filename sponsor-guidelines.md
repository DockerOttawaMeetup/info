# sponsor guidelines

Here are the basics:
- Sponsoring a Docker Ottawa Meetup is great way to get visibility and contribute to the local development community.
- Sponsors pay for pizza and drinks at a meetup ($200).
- They get introduced at the beginning of the meeting, they get a slide, and they can give a short (2-3 minute overview) of who they are and why they are here (we try to make it fairly brief so that it doesnâ€™t take over the meeting).
- Recruiters typically come with some handouts or swag and setup a table.  They usually stick around until the break (15 min break is after the first talk 7:15 ish).
- Sponsors usually get good traffic during the break.
- Sponsors get a link/picture in the Docker meetup page (most recent sponsor at the top).
- We can send sponsors a PO invoice to provide appropriate paperwork.
- Refer to [Docker Meetup Sponsorship Guidelines](https://github.com/docker/community/blob/master/Organizers/Resources/sponsorship%20guidelines.md) for additional details.
- Have questions?  Interested in sponsoring?  You can use the Contact button on our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Ottawa/) to reach us for more information.
